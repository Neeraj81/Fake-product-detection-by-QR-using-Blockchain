## About <a name="description"></a>
+ In today’s world, how do you know if you are buying a genuine product?
+ For more than a decade now, RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) technology has been quite effective in providing anti-counterfeits measures in the supply chain.
+ We leverage the idea of Bitcoin’s blockchain that anyone can check the proof of possession of balance. Along with this, we plan to use QR codes.
+ We plan to implement a proof-of-concept system employing a blockchain-based decentralized application which gives a customer the entire history of a product (eg - brand info, owner, etc).

### Data Flow

### Why blockchain? <a name="why_blockchain"></a>
+ Unlike a normal database, Blockchain has a non-destructive (immutable) way to track data changes over time. This means that data is not editable rather, whenever updates are made, a new block is added to the “block-chain”. This helps track historical data (authenticity and owner data) of a product.
+ Given the amount of data to be dealt with (large amount of products being developed), if you have to keep track of all of them, it is better to have a decentralized and distributed network of nodes so that no entity can tamper with the product data and we also obtain 100% up time.
+ Transparent nature of the Blockchain helps avoid [parallel trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_import).
+ Using Blockchain, authenticity can be checked and ownership of a product can be transferred _decades_ from now; even if the product is discontinued.

## Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
Installing NodeJs
```
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
Installing [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)


### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Cloning the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kylelobo/AuthentiFi.git
```
Installing the dependencies
```
$ cd AuthentiFi
$ npm install
```
Running the server
```
$ node server.js
```

## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>
**1. Instantiate your data directory**
```
geth --datadir ./myDataDir init ./myGenesis.json
```

**2. Start your Ethereum peer node.**

+ Networkid helps ensure the privacy of your network. You can use any number here (where we used “1114”), but other peers joining your network must use the same one.
```
geth --datadir ./myDataDir --networkid 1114 console 2>> myEth.log
```
+ Output should look like this:
```
Welcome to the Geth JavaScript console!

instance: Geth/v1.7.3-stable-4bb3c89d/darwin-amd64/go1.8.3
coinbase: 0xae13d41d66af28380c7af6d825ab557eb271ffff
at block: 5 (Thu, 07 Dec 2017 17:08:48 PST)
datadir: /Users/test/my-eth-chain/myDataDir
modules: admin:1.0 clique:1.0 debug:1.0 eth:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0 web3:1.0

>
```
This is the geth JavaScript console. Any command with the symbol > should be typed here.

**3. Display your Ethereum logs**

+ Open another terminal window
+ ```cd my-eth-chain```
+ Type ```tail -f myEth.log```

**4. Import/Create an Account**

+ If you allocated ETH in the Genesis file, import the corresponding account by dragging the UTC file into the ```myDataDir/keystoredirectory``` and skip to step 5.
+ In the geth JavaScript console, create an account:
```
> personal.newAccount("<YOUR_PASSPHRASE>")
```
+ Do not forget this passphrase! You will be typing this a lot, so for this test network you can keep it simple.

**5. Set Default Account**
+ Check your default account, type
```
> eth.coinbase
```
+ If this address is the same as the one from step 4, skip the rest of step 5.
+ To set your default account, type 
```
> miner.setEtherbase(web3.eth.accounts[0])
```

**6. Start mining**
+ Check your balance with 
```
> eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase)
```
+ Run 
```
> miner.start()
```
+ Look at your other terminal window, you should see some mining action in the logs. Check your balance again and it should be higher.
+ To end mining, type
```
> miner.stop()
```

## Limitations <a name="limitations"></a>
+ The user needs to have a QR code scanner in order to check the product information.
+ Products that have already been manufactured prior to today cannot be tracked.
+ We currently depend on the company to register with our services, without which, we cannot provide information about a brand to the user.

## Future Scope <a name="future_scope"></a>
+ To track every genuine product that is to be sold.
+ Implement this idea in other fields.
+ Virtual transactions
+ Using tamper-proof tags
+ Dynamic (read & write NFC tags)
+ QR codes which have secure graphic
+ Implement our own tokens which can be sold to users so that they can purchase ownership of a product using tokens which helps in insurance processing.
